# Scrubby.Web

**Author's note: this is now discontinued with /tg/station's loss of interest in public logs. So long, and thanks for all the fish.**

This is the web front-end for the Scrubby suite of log-parsing software for /tg/station.

The aim of this repository is to allow for better transparency regarding the code of Scrubby, as well as to allow those inquisitive individuals to learn about it.

*Note: The previous repository (ScrubbyWebPublic) has been removed in favor of having a combined repository that shows the live code without any tweaks!*
